![Overview](doc/overview_thinkpad_p14s.png)

This repo fullfills two purposes:
* Of course this is my personal backup - if something happens to my precious ;)
* For everyboy who likes my setup and wants to use it him/herself

For some people the colors will truly be shocking. I personally enjoy it a bit
more "trashy" so don't hate! The colors are all taken from a syntax theme that
I personally enjoy: [catpuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin). All
of the provided config files are obviously easiest to use by just symlinking at
their correct spot.

This repository includes both config files for macOS and GNU/Linux. This branch
represents the config files for my Lenovo ThinkPad P14s running Arch Linux.
